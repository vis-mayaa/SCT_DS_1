This project involves analyzing worldwide unemployment rates using a real-world dataset. The objective was to create visualizations to identify patterns and highlight countries with the highest unemployment rates. The notebook includes a bar chart displaying the top 10 countries with the highest unemployment rates in 2021.

## Task Objective  
Explore and analyze a global unemployment dataset to:

- Visualize the distribution of unemployment rates across countries.
- Identify countries with the highest unemployment rates in 2021.
- Practice data cleaning, sorting, and plotting techniques.
